The numerous responsibilities of the engineer require advanced technical knowledge, especially in economics, human skills, and environmental awareness. In addition to technical skills, the engineer must have strong leadership capabilities in personnel management, project management, and business management. More than an expert, the engineer is also a manager. A large part of their work time is spent studying projects in light of the human, economic, and financial constraints they involve.
